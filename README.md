Hi!

This project is an exercise intended to review and use several skills I learned in The Odin Project's web development curriculum.
I'll be testing what I learned in HTML and CSS, as well as github workflow.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
