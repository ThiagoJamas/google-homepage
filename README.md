Hi!

This project is an exercise intended to review and use several skills I learned in The Odin Project's web development curriculum.
I'll be testing what I learned in HTML and CSS, as well as github workflow.

Update - January 13rd 2020
It took me around 4 days to complete the assignment. Contrary to some recommendations from The Odin Project, I got a little stuck with details. It probably made me take longer than it should, but I believe I learned more in the process. 

I "upgraded" my understanding about how div works as well as other tag and elements. But the biggest challenge was positioning and styling with CSS (it is for everybody who's learning, I imagine). But, again, I take all the struggle as an oportunity to learn (after the tempers have cooled down) and I believe and learned a lot!

The main skills I developed a little more during this exercise are:


1.  Two ways to move a div around on the page
2.  Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
3.  Identify the background color of an existing webpage
4.  Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
5.  Center an element horizontally
6.  Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
7.  Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
8.  Build a very basic form (even if it doesn't "go" anywhere)
