Hi!

This project is an exercise intended to review and use several skills I learned in The Odin Project's web development curriculum.
I'll be testing what I learned in HTML and CSS, as well as github workflow.

Update - January 13rd 2020
It took me around 4 days to complete the assignment. Contrary to some recommendations from The Odin Project, I got a little stuck with details. It probably made me take longer than it should, but I believe I learned more in the process. 

I "upgraded" my understanding about how div works as well as other tag and elements. But the biggest challenge was positioning and styling with CSS (it is for everybody who's learning, I imagine). But, again, I take all the struggle as an oportunity to learn (after the tempers have cooled down) and I believe and learned a lot!
